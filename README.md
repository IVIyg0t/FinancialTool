# FinancialTool
CMSC 420 Financial Tool Project

I suggest that you guys manage your commits and checkouts using the GitHub Application:
Windows:
  https://windows.github.com/
Mac:
  https://mac.github.com/
  
Once you've installed it, create a folder that will house all of the files/folders in this "Financial Tool" Repo.

Then open up the github application, sign yourself in, and add the Financial Tool Repo to the folder that you created.

The Folder will then sync with all the files/folders on the repo.

Next I would create a copy of the Project i've uploaded and place is somewhere for you to work on.
Once you've finished the functionality that your working on, I would suggest uploaded it as AcctMgr_V1.1 or something similar.
This will preserve the base skeleten project files so that later we can merge all of our projects together to complete AcctMgr_V2

Thanks,
Taylor

Uploading your project to GitHub:
1.  Copy/Paste your project folder into the folder you created that will house the GitHub folders/files.
2.  Go to the GitHub application, and you should see above history that there are "Uncommited changes".  You should click this, and a summary/description will drop down below, and the contents of the uncomitted changes will show in the right side of the screen.
3.  Fill in the summery/description describing what you have done to the application (Please be as derscriptive as possible). Referencing where you've added stuff would be a good idea (Function names and so on).
4.  Once you've filled in the information, click commmit to master.  Then click Sync on the top right corner.
5.  Your files should now be uploaded to the GitHub repo.
